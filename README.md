Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Python program to manage student grades. It allows users to input grades, calculate averages, and determine the overall performance, represented by letter grades or GPA.

Key Activities
Grade Input:

Enables entry of grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Average Calculation:

Calculates the average grade across all entries.
Performance Display:

Outputs average grade with the corresponding letter grade or GPA.
Technology Used
Programming Language: Python
Data Management: Uses dictionaries and lists for efficient grade storage and processing.
Calculations: Implements arithmetic operations to derive averages and determine letter grades.
Interaction: Uses input() for text-based user input and output.
Key Insights
Demonstrates proficiency in Python with a focus on data structures and computational logic.
Employs a modular structure for easy scalability and maintenance.
Potential upgrades include:
Graphical grade representation (e.g., charts).
Development of a user-friendly GUI interface.
Integration with external tools for importing/exporting grades.
